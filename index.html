            <ol>
                <li>What are the topics you need to learn?</li>
                <li>What are the subtopics you need to master in order to master that topic?</li>
                <li>How strong is the goal you set?</li>
                <li>What are the things you need to done your plan?</li>
                <li>In what sequence and timing should you teach these concepts to yourself?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first step to teaching yourself is to make a plan. Remember when you are taking a university or high school course, on the first day of each course, you always receive a syllabus that outlines exactly what you will be learning that semester and what the timeline would look like. When you are teaching yourself, you want to do the same thing.</p>
            <p>And as the field of technology is constantly changing, it’s really important that you master the skill of teaching
            yourself new things so that you can upgrade your skill set even after you’ve successfully launched a career in the
            field. Let’s get started!</p>

            <header>Take It Slow</header>
            <code></code>
            <p>Understanding a topic deeply usually takes much more time than you think. So I recommend budgeting at least twice the time you think you need for each subtopic and stick to that timeline. So if you think a concept will take you two days to understand, spend four days on it.</p>
            <p>Even if you do gain a basic understanding of the topic well under the timeline, spending extra time researching a topic
            will only deepen your understanding of the subject matter.</p>

            <p>Next up, different people will prefer to learn in different ways. And you’ll probably find that you prefer to learn
            about different topics in different ways too.</p>
            <p>So experiment with different types of learning resources like blogs, videos, and interactive tutorials to see what you
            prefer. I personally really like writing things down and teaching others. Experiment to find out how you learn best.</p>

            <code></code>
            <p>People who teach others online make mistakes too. I have certainly made mistakes in my blog posts. So it’s always good
            to verify your knowledge using multiple different versions of the same resource instead of using one resource as your
            only source of information.</p>
            <p>For instance, if you are learning how to efficiently build a certain functionality, take that Stack Overflow answer with
            a grain of salt. What do other people say about the topic? What do the top experts in the field say about the topic?
            Always use more than one source of information and never trust a resource completely. And that brings us to our final
            tip.</p>

            <header>Test Yourself and Track Your Progress</header>
            <code></code>
            <p>As you execute your own learning plan, you need to make sure that you are on track and actually learning what you should
            be learning. And reading about a topic versus actually retaining the knowledge are two very different things. You need
            to test yourself to measure your progress.</p>
            <p>There are a lot of ways to test your knowledge. One of the things I like to do is to write down everything I know about
            a topic, and then go back and reference my notes to see if I missed anything or got anything wrong. For instance, let’s
            say you are learning about defending against SQL injection. You can try to write down every defense you know against SQL
            injection, then explain their differences, in what context you should use each defense, and so on.</p>
